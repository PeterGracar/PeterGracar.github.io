Problem Sheet 1 Problem Sheet 1 This sheet will be discussed in the seminar on Friday, 4th October 2024. The solutions will be discussed in the seminar 1 week later. Problem 1.1. What is the price of an option with payoff h(S_{1})=S_{1} ? Solution The price of the option will be equal to S_{0} . One explanation is using replicating strategies. The obvious replicating strategy is (x=S_{0},\\phi=1) . Therefore the option should also have price S_{0} . Alternatively, one can use risk-neutral probabilities, namely \\tilde{p}=\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d} and 1-\\tilde{p}=\\frac{u-1-r}{u-d} . To calculate the price we have: E_{\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}}\\Big{(}\\frac{h(S_{1})}{1+r}\\Big{)}=E_{\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}% }\\Big{(}\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r}\\Big{)}=S_{0}, by the properties of the risk-neutral measure. Problem 1.2. Compute the hedging strategies (the replicating strategies) for a European Call and Put options with the strike price K=1 and the maturity time t=1 in the elementary market model with parameters: r=\\frac{1}{3} , S_{0}=1 , u=2 , d=\\frac{1}{2} , p=\\frac{3}{4} . Solution S_{1}=\\begin{cases}2,&H\\\\ \\frac{1}{2},&T.\\end{cases} The call option has payoff P^{c}=\\begin{cases}1,&H\\\\ 0,&T.\\end{cases} and the put option has payoff P^{p}=\\begin{cases}0,&H\\\\ \\frac{1}{2},&T.\\end{cases} The replication strategy for the call is \\displaystyle(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}(H)=P^{c}(H) \\displaystyle(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}(T)=P^{c}(T) i.e. \\displaystyle(x-\\phi)\\frac{4}{3}+\\phi 2=1 \\displaystyle(x-\\phi)\\frac{4}{3}+\\phi\\frac{1}{2}=0 Solving this equation gives \\phi=\\frac{1-0}{2-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{2}{3}. Substituting this back in gives x=\\frac{5}{12} . Doing the same for the put gives \\phi=-\\frac{1}{3} and x=\\frac{1}{6} . Problem 1.3. Prove that the condition d<1+r<u implies that there is no arbitrage in the elementary single period market model. Solution Arbitrage is a strategy that (1)​starts with no money, so x=0 , (2)​has zero probability of losing money, so V_{1}(x,\\phi)\\geq 0 , (3)​has positive probability of making money, so V_{1}(x,\\phi)>0 for at least one event. Recall that V_{1}(x,\\phi)=\\begin{cases}(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{0}u,&H\\\\ (x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{0}d,&T\\end{cases}. Let x=0 , \\phi>0 . It then follows that V_{1}=\\begin{cases}S_{0}\\phi(u-(1+r))>0,&H\\\\ S_{0}\\phi(d-(1+r))<0,&T\\end{cases}, which violates the second condition. Problem 1.4. Consider the elementary single period market model with parameters: r=\\frac{1}{3} , S_{0}=1 , u=2 , d=\\frac{1}{2} , p=\\frac{3}{4} . Compute the price of a digital call option with strike price K which is characterized by the payoff function h(S_{1})=\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{ll}1,&\\text{if }S_{1}\\geq K,\\\\ 0,&\\text{otherwise.}\\end{array}\\right. Notice that the price depends on a real number K which is a parameter of the option. Solution S_{1} is as in the previous exercise. If K>2 we have that the payoff of the digital option is always 0, so the replicating strategy is (x,\\phi)=(0,0) . If \\frac{1}{2}<K\\leq 2 , the payoff is 1 in H and 0 in T . This gives the system of equations \\displaystyle(x-\\phi)\\frac{4}{3}+\\phi 2=1 \\displaystyle(x-\\phi)\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{1}{2}\\phi=0 Subtracting the two gives \\phi=\\frac{1}{2-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{2}{3} and so x=\\frac{5}{12} . If K\\leq\\frac{1}{2} , the payoff is always 1 . Calculating as above, \\phi=0 and x=\\frac{3}{4} . Remark: You will be able to solve the following 3 problems after our second lecture! Problem 1.5. Give a proof of the Put-Call Parity. Solution The formula: C-P=S_{0}-\\frac{1}{1+r}K. Consider two portfolios. •​Portfolio 1: 1 call option + K\\frac{1}{1+r} in cash At time t=1 this portfolio has has value (S_{1}-K)^{+}+K=\\begin{cases}S_{1}-K+K,&S_{1}>K,\\\\ 0+K,&S_{1}\\leq K.\\end{cases} •​Portfolio 2: 1 put option + 1 share of stock At time t=1 this portfolio has has value (K-S_{1})^{+}+S_{1}=\\begin{cases}S_{1},&S_{1}>K\\\\ K-S_{1}+S_{1},&S_{1}\\leq K\\end{cases} The two portfolios have equal payoffs at t=1 , so to avoid arbitrage they need to have the same value at t=0 . Problem 1.6. Under the assumption that the elementary single period market model is arbitrage free show that there exists a random variable Z such that the price of an European option with the payoff h(S_{1}) can be computed by the formula x=\\mathbb{E}\\left(Zh(S_{1})\\right). Solution Assuming no arbitrage gives us that there exists a risk-neutral measure. We want to show that there exists a Z s.t. x=\\mathbb{E}(Zh(S_{1})) and x=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}}\\big{(}\\frac{h(S_{1})}{1+r}\\big{)} The second equation can be expressed as x=\\frac{1}{1+r}(\\tilde{p}h(S_{1}(H))+(1-\\tilde{p})h(S_{1}(T)) while the first equation gives x=pZ(H)h(S_{1}(H))+(1-p)Z(T)h(S_{1}(T)) Combining the two gives that if we set Z(H)=\\frac{\\tilde{p}}{p}\\frac{1}{1+r} and Z(T)=\\frac{1-\\tilde{p}}{1-p}\\frac{1}{1+r}, Z satisfies the requirement. Such a Z is called the Radon-Nikodym derivative or the State-Price density. Problem 1.7. Consider the elementary single period market model with parameters r=\\frac{1}{3} , S_{0}=1 , u=2 , d=\\frac{1}{2} , p=\\frac{3}{4} . Find all probability measures \\mathbb{Q} that assign positive values to both states H and T and satisfy S_{0}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r}, where \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r}=\\frac{S_{1}(H)}{1+r}\\mathbb{Q}(H)+% \\frac{S_{1}(T)}{1+r}\\mathbb{Q}(T). Solution \\mathbb{Q} is a probability measure so \\mathbb{Q}(H)+\\mathbb{Q}(t)=1 . We also want \\mathbb{Q}(H) and \\mathbb{Q}(T) to be strictly positive. Since \\mathbb{Q} satisfies S_{0}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r} by assumption, this gives that 1=\\frac{1}{1+r}(\\mathbb{Q}(H)u+\\mathbb{Q}(T)d). Combined with \\mathbb{Q}(H)+\\mathbb{Q}(t)=1 this gives \\mathbb{Q}(T)=\\frac{u-1-r}{u-d} and \\mathbb{Q}(H)=\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}. In our example this gives \\mathbb{Q}(H)=\\frac{5}{9}>0 and \\mathbb{Q}(T)=\\frac{4}{9}>0 , so this is the unique solution to the problem. Numerical solutions P1.2: (x,\\phi)=(\\frac{5}{12},\\frac{2}{3}) and (x,\\phi)=(\\frac{1}{6},-\\frac{1}{3}) . P1.4: For K>2 , (x,\\phi)=(0,0) . For K>\\frac{1}{2} , (x,\\phi)=(\\frac{5}{12},\\frac{2}{3}) . For K\\leq\\frac{1}{2} , (x,\\phi)=(\\frac{3}{4},0) . P1.7: \\mathbb{Q}(H)=\\frac{5}{9} and \\mathbb{Q}(T)=\\frac{4}{9} .

Revision Sheet 1 (Pricing) Revision Sheet 1 (Pricing) Problem 1.1. (a)​The price of a European Put option with strike K=50 in a single period market with risk-free interest rate r=0.1 per period is equal to P=1.2 . The current price of the underlying stock is S_{0}=60 . Find the price of a European Call option on the same stock with the same strike and maturity as the Put above (b)​Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Justify your answer. “In an arbitrage-free but incomplete market model, there might be contingent claims that have a unique risk-neutral price”. (c)​Define the two Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion and calculate their values for the following utility function: u(x)=\\sqrt{x}. (d)​Consider a two-period market model with one stock and one risk-free bond. The risk-free interest rate is equal to r=0.2 per period and the stock’s price dynamics are given in the following table: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} \\omega_{4} S_{0} 100 100 100 100 S_{1} 110 110 90 90 S_{2} 121 99 99 81 Show that this model is not arbitrage free. Solution (a)​From the Put-Call parity, we have that \\text{Price of Call}-\\text{Price of Put}=S_{0}-\\frac{1}{1+r}K. In our case, this results in Price of Call \\displaystyle=\\text{Price of Put}+S_{0}-\\frac{1}{1+r}K \\displaystyle=1.2+60-\\frac{1}{1.1}\\cdot 50 \\displaystyle\\simeq 15.75. (b)​I agree. These are the attainable contingent claims. (c)​The Coefficient of Absolute Risk Aversion is a(x)=-\\frac{u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{u^{\\prime}(x)}. The Coefficient of Relative Risk Aversion is r(x)=-\\frac{xu^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{u^{\\prime}(x)}. For u(x)=\\sqrt{x} , we have u^{\\prime}(x)=(x^{1/2})^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2} and u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=-\\frac{1}{4}x^{-3/2}. Consequently, a(x)=-\\frac{-\\frac{1}{4}x^{-3/2}}{\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}}=\\frac{1}{2x}\\quad\\text{% (Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion)} and r(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\quad\\text{(Constant Relative Risk Aversion)}. (d)​We can draw the tree for this market model: \\xymatrix@R-8pt{&*+[F]{S_{2}=121}\\omega_{1}\\\\ *+[F]{S_{1}=110}\\arrow[ur]\\arrow[dr]\\\\ *+[F]{S_{2}=99}\\omega_{2}\\\\ *+[F]{S_{0}=100}\\arrow[uur]\\arrow[ddr]\\\\ *+[F]{S_{2}=99}\\omega_{3}\\\\ *+[F]{S_{1}=90}\\arrow[ur]\\arrow[dr]\\\\ *+[F]{S_{2}=81}\\omega_{4}} We can quickly see that at each step the stock price goes up by a factor u=1.1 or down by a factor d=0.9 . Therefore, each individual one-period conditional tree has arbitrage because u=1.1<1.2=1+r . Problem 1.2. Consider the single period coin-toss market model (\\Omega=\\{H,T\\}=(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2})) with one stock and one bank account. The known parameters are S_{0}=10,S_{1}(H)=12 and r=0.1 . (a)​What is the range of possible values S_{1}(T) such that there is no arbitrage in the model? (b)​Consider the case S_{1}(T)=9 for this and the remaining parts of Problem 1.2. Give the risk neutral measure \\mathbb{P} , that is, \\mathbb{P}(H) and \\mathbb{P}(T) . (c)​What is the solution of the hedging problem of the European Put option with strike price K=11 ? What should be the price of the option? (d)​Draw the sets \\mathcal{P}^{+},\\mathbb{A},\\mathbb{W} and \\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} in the (T,H) plane, that is, the set of probability measures, the location of the arbitrage strategies, the location of the value processes with zero initial investment and its perpendicular subspace, respectively. (e)​State the fundamental theorem of asset pricing for a general discrete time market model. Explain the statement of the theorem using the sets \\mathcal{P}^{+},\\mathbb{A},\\mathbb{W} and \\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} . (f)​Explain the statement of the theorem for the above single period coin toss model (remember that S_{1}(T)=9 ). Solution \\xymatrix@R-8pt{&*+[F]{S_{1}(H)=12}\\\\ *+[F]{S_{0}=10}\\arrow[ur]\\arrow[dr]\\\\ *+[F]{S_{1}(T)=?}} (a)​To ensure there is no arbitrage in the market, we must have d<1+r , that is \\frac{S_{1}(T)}{S_{0}}<1+r\\Leftrightarrow\\frac{S_{1}(T)}{10}<1.1% \\Leftrightarrow S_{1}(T)<11. Since the stock price should always remain positive, we have 0<S_{1}(T)<11 . (b)​We have S_{1}(T)=9 . The risk-neutral measure should satisfy \\tilde{p}\\frac{S_{1}(H)}{1+r}+(1-\\tilde{p})\\frac{S_{1}(T)}{1+r}=S_{0}. Plugging in the values, this is \\tilde{p}\\cdot 12+(1-\\tilde{p})\\cdot 9=11\\Leftrightarrow 3\\tilde{p}=2% \\Leftrightarrow\\tilde{p}=\\frac{2}{3}. Therefore \\mathbb{P}(H)=\\frac{2}{3} and \\mathbb{P}(T)=\\frac{1}{3} . Alternatively, we can calculate u=\\frac{12}{10} and d=\\frac{9}{10} and \\tilde{p}=\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}=\\frac{1.1-0.9}{1.2-0.9}=\\frac{2}{3} and the rest is then as above. (c)​Since the payoff of the European Put option is X^{P}=(K-S_{1})^{+} , we are dealing with \\xymatrix@R-8pt{&*+[F]{X^{P}(H)=0}\\\\ *+[F]{x^{P}=?}\\arrow[ur]\\arrow[dr]\\\\ *+[F]{X^{P}(T)=2}} To find the hedging/replicating strategy, we must solve the equation (x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}=X, which in our case is equivalent to the system \\displaystyle(x-\\phi\\cdot 10)\\cdot 1.1+12\\cdot\\phi \\displaystyle=0, \\displaystyle(x-\\phi\\cdot 10)\\cdot 1.1+9\\cdot\\phi \\displaystyle=2. Solving for \\phi gives \\phi=\\frac{0-2}{12-9}=-\\frac{2}{3}. Plugging this into the first equation then gives (x+\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 10)\\cdot 1.1-12\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}=0\\Leftrightarrow x=0.606. The hedging strategy therefore starts with an initial investment x=0.606 and “buying” -\\frac{2}{3} of a share of the stock (so in fact, short-selling), as well as investing 0.606+\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 10\\simeq 7.2 into the money market. The price of the option should coincide with the price of the replicating strategy, so x^{P}=0.606 . (d)​We have \\Delta\\hat{S}_{1}=\\begin{cases}\\frac{12}{1.1}-10=0.9091,&H\\\\ \\frac{9}{1.1}-10=-1.8182,&T\\end{cases}. The sets we want to draw are \\displaystyle=\\{X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}|X=\\hat{G}(x,\\phi)=\\phi\\Delta\\hat{S}_{1}\\}, \\displaystyle{\\color{blue}\\mathbb{W}^{\\perp}} \\displaystyle=\\{Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}|\\langle X,Y\\rangle=0,X\\in\\mathbb{W}\\}, \\displaystyle{\\color{gray}\\mathbb{A}} \\displaystyle=\\{X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}|X\\geq 0,X\\neq 0\\}, and \\displaystyle\\mathcal{P}^{+} \\displaystyle=\\{X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}|X(H)+X(T)=1,X(H),X(T)>0\\}. Figure 4 shows the corresponding sets on the plane \\mathbb{R}^{2} . The sets Figure 3. The sets \\mathbb{W} (red line), \\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} (blue line), \\mathbb{A} (grey wavy area) and \\mathcal{P}^{+} (diagonal line in black). The intersection of \\mathcal{P}^{+} with \\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} is the sought after risk neutral measure (within the quadrant \\mathbb{A}^{+} ). (e)​The fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that a model is arbitrage-free if and only if there exists at least one risk-neutral measure. The set of risk-neutral measures is given by \\mathcal{P}^{+}\\cap\\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} . The set of arbitrage strategies is given by \\mathbb{W}\\cap\\mathbb{A} . Therefore, the previous statement is equivalent to the following statement. The market model is arbitrage-free if and only if \\mathcal{P}^{+}\\cap\\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} is non-empty. This statement is equivalent to \\mathbb{W}\\cap\\mathbb{A} being empty. (f)​In this model, we have calculated the risk-neutral measure as \\mathbb{P}(H)=\\frac{2}{3} and \\mathbb{P}(T)=\\frac{1}{3} . As we can see in Figure 4, the \\Delta\\hat{S}_{1} values have different signs. Therefore, the set \\mathbb{W} is a line in the 2nd and 4th quadrant. Its orthogonal complement is the perpendicular line that crosses \\mathcal{P}^{+} in the point (\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3}) . Problem 1.3. Consider a one-period market model consisting of a bond and a stock with the following prices. •​At time 0: B_{0}=1\\quad and\\quad S_{0}^{1}=3 •​At time 1: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} B_{1} 1.1 1.1 1.1 S_{1}^{1} 6 4 2 (a)​Calculate the interest rate r . (b)​Compute the set of risk neutral measures for this model. (c)​Is this market arbitrage-free? Why? (d)​Is this market complete? Why? (e)​ABC Bank decides to introduce a new product with payoff \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} S_{1}^{2} 0 2 0 It is decided that the this product will be sold at a price of S_{0}^{2} =1/2. Check that the market is now complete and arbitrage-free. Solution (a)​ \\displaystyle r=\\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}}-1=\\frac{1.1}{1}-1=0.1 . (b)​We want \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r})=S_{0} . This is equivalent to the system \\displaystyle 6q_{1}+4q_{2}+2q_{3} \\displaystyle=3\\cdot 1.1, \\displaystyle q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3} \\displaystyle=1. \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle 6(1-q_{2}-q_{3})+4q_{2}+2q_{3} \\displaystyle=3.3, \\displaystyle q_{1} \\displaystyle=1-q_{2}-q_{3}. \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle 2q_{2}+4q_{3} \\displaystyle=2.7, \\displaystyle q_{1} \\displaystyle=1-q_{2}-q_{3}. \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle q_{2} \\displaystyle=1.35-2q_{3}, \\displaystyle q_{1} \\displaystyle=q_{3}-0.35. Therefore, \\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\lambda-0.35\\\\ 1.35-2\\lambda\\\\ \\lambda\\end{array}\\right) . Since this needs to be a risk-neutral measure, it must hold that \\lambda>0 (since q_{3}>0 ), \\lambda<0.675 (since q_{2}>0 , i.e. 1.35-2\\lambda>0 ) and \\lambda>0.35 (since q_{1}>0 ). Combined, this gives \\lambda\\in(0.35,0.675) . Different parameterisations of course give equivalent solutions. (c)​Yes, from the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, this market is arbitrage-free since there exists at least one risk-neutral measure. (d)​No, this is an incomplete market as there is more than 1 risk-neutral measure. (e)​Let us find the new risk neutral measure when the asset is included. We are therefore solving the system \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{1}^{1}}{1+r}) \\displaystyle=S_{0}^{1} \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{1+r}) \\displaystyle=S_{0}^{2} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{i}) \\displaystyle=1 \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle 6q_{1}+4q_{2}+2q_{3} \\displaystyle=3.3 \\displaystyle 2q_{2} \\displaystyle=0.5\\cdot 1.1 \\displaystyle q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3} \\displaystyle=1. This system has a unique solution \\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}0.1875\\\\ 0.275\\\\ 0.5375\\end{array}\\right) . The market is therefore now arbitrage-free and complete. Revision Sheet 2 (Investment) Problem 2.1. The correlation \\rho between assets A and B is 0.1 . The other data is given in the following table: Asset \\bar{R} \\sigma A 10\\% 15\\% B 18\\% 30\\% (a)​Find the proportions \\alpha of A and (1-\\alpha) of B that define a portfolio of A and B having minimum standard deviation. (b)​What is the value of this minimum standard deviation? (c)​What is the expected return of this portfolio? Solution (a)​We first calculate the covariance as \\sigma_{AB}=\\rho\\sigma_{A}\\sigma_{B}=0.0045. We are therefore looking for the minimiser of \\mathcal{L}(\\alpha)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha^{2}\\sigma_{A}^{2}+(1-\\alpha)^{2}\\sigma_% {B}^{2}+2\\alpha(1-\\alpha)\\sigma_{AB}). Note: We could have set the proportions of the two assets independently and added the condition that their sum needs to be equal to 1. This would lead to the same solution once we substitute the condition into the remaining equations. Taking the partial derivative and setting it to zero we have \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial\\alpha}=\\alpha\\sigma_{A}^{2}-(% 1-\\alpha)\\sigma_{B}^{2}+\\sigma_{AB}-2\\alpha\\sigma_{AB}=0, which is equivalent to \\alpha=\\frac{\\sigma_{B}^{2}-\\sigma_{AB}}{\\sigma_{A}^{2}+\\sigma_{B}^{2}-2\\sigma% _{AB}}=0.826. (b)​The standard deviation is equal to SD=\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2}\\sigma_{A}^{2}+(1-\\alpha)^{2}\\sigma_{B}^{2}+2\\alpha(1-% \\alpha)\\sigma_{AB}}\\overset{\\alpha=0.826}{=}0.139. (c)​The expected return is \\bar{R}=\\alpha\\bar{R}^{A}+(1-\\alpha)\\bar{R}^{B}\\simeq 0.114. Problem 2.2. Two stocks are available. The corresponding expected rates of return are \\bar{R}^{1} and \\bar{R}^{2} . The corresponding variances and covariance are \\sigma_{1}^{2} , \\sigma_{2}^{2} and \\sigma_{12} . What percentages of the total investment should be invested in each of the two stocks to minimise the total variance of return of the resulting portfolio? What is the mean rate of return of this portfolio? Solution Let \\alpha be the proportion of wealth invested in the 1st asset. This problem is the same as the previous, with the actual values left in their full generality. We are therefore solving \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial\\alpha}=\\alpha\\sigma_{1}^{2}-(% 1-\\alpha)\\sigma_{2}^{2}+\\sigma_{12}-2\\alpha\\sigma_{12}=0, which gives the solution \\alpha=\\frac{\\sigma_{2}^{2}-\\sigma_{12}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{2}^{2}-2\\sigma% _{12}}. Consequently, 1-\\alpha=\\frac{\\sigma_{1}^{2}-\\sigma_{12}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{2}^{2}-2% \\sigma_{12}}. The expected return is therefore \\bar{R}=\\alpha\\bar{R}^{1}+(1-\\alpha)\\bar{R}^{2}=\\frac{(\\sigma_{2}^{2}-\\sigma_{% 12})\\bar{R}^{1}+(\\sigma_{1}^{2}-\\sigma_{12})\\bar{R}^{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma% _{2}^{2}-2\\sigma_{12}} Problem 2.3. Suppose there are n assets which are uncorrelated. You may invest in any one, or in any combination of them. The mean rate of return \\bar{R} is the same for each asset, but the variances are different. The return on asset i has a variance \\sigma_{i}^{2} for i=1,\\dots,n . (a)​Show the situation on a mean-variance diagram. Describe the efficient set. (b)​Find the minimum-variance point. Express your result in terms of \\bar{\\sigma}^{2}=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right)^{-1}. Solution (a)​The minimum-variance diagram is depicted in Figure 4. The efficient set is the red line in the diagram. The mean-variance diagram, with Figure 4. The mean-variance diagram, with mvp being the minimum variance portfolio and the red line depicting the efficient set. The assets must not necessarily be ordered in an increasing order and are presented here as such for clarity. (b)​Since the assets are uncorrelated, we are solving the problem \\displaystyle\\min \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{2}\\sigma_{i}^{2} s.t. \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}=1. The corresponding Lagrangian is \\mathcal{L}(w_{i},\\lambda)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{2}\\sigma_{i}^{2})-% \\lambda(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}-1). Takin partial derivatives, we obtain the system \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{i}}=w_{i}\\sigma_{i}^{2}-% \\lambda=0 \\displaystyle\\Leftrightarrow w_{i}=\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} \\displaystyle i=1\\dots n \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial\\lambda}=0 \\displaystyle\\Leftrightarrow\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}=1. Substituting the first n equations into the last one, we have that it is equivalent to \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}=1\\Leftrightarrow\\lambda=\\left(% \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right)^{-1}=:\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}. Therefore, the proportions of asset i in the minimum variance portfolio is equal to w_{i}=\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} . Problem 2.4. There are just three assets with rates of return R_{1} , R_{2} and R_{3} , respectively. The covariance matrix and the expected rates of return are V=\\left[\\begin{array}[]{ccc}0.2&0.1&0\\\\ 0.1&0.2&0.1\\\\ 0&0.1&0.2\\end{array}\\right]\\quad\\bar{R}=\\left[\\begin{array}[]{c}0.4\\\\ 0.8\\\\ 0.8\\end{array}\\right] (a)​Find the minimum-variance portfolio (Hint: By symmetry w_{1}=w_{3} ). (b)​Find another efficient portfolio by setting \\lambda_{1}=1 , \\lambda_{2}=0 . Solution (a)​Using the hint that w_{1}=w_{3} , the resulting Lagrangian is \\displaystyle\\mathcal{L}(w_{1},w_{2},\\mu) \\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{2}(2w_{1}^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}\\sigma_{2}^{2}+2w_% {1}w_{2}\\sigma_{12}+2w_{2}w_{1}\\sigma_{23})-\\mu(2w_{1}+w_{2}-1) \\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{2}(0.4w_{1}^{2}+0.2w_{2}^{2}+0.4w_{1}w_{2})-\\lambda_{2}% (2w_{1}+w_{2}-1). Note: The full Lagrangian would also depend on \\lambda_{1} as the factor in front of the condition that we want our portfolio to have a given expected return. Since we are looking for the minimum variance portfolio without requiring a fixed return, the condition is not present, i.e. \\lambda_{1}=0 . Taking the partial derivatives, we obtain \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{1}} \\displaystyle=0.4w_{1}+0.2w_{2}-2\\mu=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{2}} \\displaystyle=0.2w_{1}+0.2w_{2}-\\mu=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial\\lambda_{2}} \\displaystyle=2w_{1}+w_{2}-1=0. The solution to this system is w_{1}=w_{3}=\\frac{1}{2} and w_{2}=0 . (b)​The Lagrangian with \\lambda_{2}=0,\\lambda_{1}=1 is \\mathcal{L}=\\frac{1}{2}(w_{1}^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}\\sigma^{2}+w_{3}^{2}% \\sigma_{3}^{2}+2w_{1}w_{2}\\sigma_{12}+2w_{2}w_{3}\\sigma_{23})-(w_{1}\\bar{R}_{1% }+w2\\bar{R}_{2}+w_{3}\\bar{R}_{3}-\\bar{r}), where \\bar{r} is some (unknown and irrelevant) desired return. Taking partial derivatives we obtain \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{1}} \\displaystyle=0.2w_{1}+0.1w_{2}-\\bar{R}_{1}=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{2}} \\displaystyle=0.2w_{2}+0.1w_{1}+0.1w_{3}-\\bar{R}_{2}=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{3}} \\displaystyle=0.2w_{3}+0.1w_{2}-\\bar{R}_{3}=0 The solution to the above system is w_{1}=1 , w_{2}=2 and w_{3}=3 . These values do not add up to 1 (since we set \\mu=0 and therefore did not require this), so we need to renormalise. The combined weights are w_{1}+w_{2}+w_{3}=6 , so the renormalised weights are \\tilde{w}_{1}=\\frac{1}{6},\\quad\\tilde{w}_{2}=\\frac{2}{6},\\quad\\tilde{w}_{3}=% \\frac{3}{6}. Problem 2.5. Assume a single-period market model with 2 stocks, 1 bond and 3 possible states of the world with subjective probabilities \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})=1/2 and \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2})=\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{3})=1/4 . At time t=0 , the prices of the stocks are S^{1}_{0}=5 and S^{2}_{0}=4 . The risk free interest rate is r_{f}=0.2 . The prices of the stocks at time t=1 are given in the following table: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} S^{1}_{1} 3 6 9 S^{2}_{1} 5 6 4 (a)​Solve the Markowitz optimisation problem for the portfolio with expected return \\bar{r}=0.3 . (b)​Using the optimal portfolio found in the previous subquestion, find an optimal portfolio with expected return \\tilde{r}=0.6 . (c)​Find the market portfolio and its expected return. Solution We first calculate the returns, mean returns and variances. \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} R_{1} -0.4 0.2 0.8 R_{2} 0.25 0.5 0 The expected returns, second moments, variances and covariances are therefore \\displaystyle\\bar{R}^{1} \\displaystyle=0.05 \\displaystyle\\bar{R}^{2} \\displaystyle=0.25 \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}(R_{1}^{2}) \\displaystyle=0.25 \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}(R_{2}^{2}) \\displaystyle=0.09375 \\displaystyle\\sigma_{1}^{2} \\displaystyle=0.2475 \\displaystyle\\sigma_{2}^{2} \\displaystyle=0.03125 \\displaystyle\\sigma_{12} \\displaystyle=\\mathbb{E}(R_{1}R_{2})-\\mathbb{E}(R_{1})\\mathbb{E}(R_{2})=-0.0375. (a)​The Lagrangian is \\mathcal{L}(w_{1},w_{2},\\lambda)=\\frac{1}{2}(w_{1}^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}% \\sigma_{2}^{2}+2w_{1}w_{2}\\sigma_{12})-\\lambda(w_{1}\\bar{R}_{1}+w_{2}\\bar{R}_{% 2}+(1-w_{1}-w_{2})r_{f}-\\bar{r}). Taking partial derivatives, we obtain the system of equations \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{1}} \\displaystyle=w_{1}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}\\sigma_{12}-\\lambda(\\bar{R}_{1}-r_{f})=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{2}} \\displaystyle=w_{2}\\sigma_{2}^{2}+w_{1}\\sigma_{12}-\\lambda(\\bar{R}_{2}-r_{f})=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial\\lambda} \\displaystyle=w_{1}\\bar{R}_{1}+w_{2}\\bar{R}_{2}+(1-w_{1}-w_{2})r_{f}-\\bar{r}=0. Solving this system we obtain w_{1}\\simeq-0.37 , w_{2}\\simeq 0.89 and w_{0}\\simeq 0.48 . (b)​The previous solution was for an expected return \\bar{r}=0.3 . We now need an optimal portfolio for the expected return \\tilde{r}=0.6 . We have \\gamma=\\frac{\\tilde{r}-\\bar{r}}{r_{f}-\\bar{r}}=\\frac{0.6-0.3}{0.2-0.3}=-3 and 1-\\gamma=4 . The new weights will therefore be \\displaystyle\\tilde{w}_{1} \\displaystyle=(1-\\gamma)w_{1}=-1.48 \\displaystyle\\tilde{w}_{2} \\displaystyle=(1-\\gamma)w_{2}=3.56 \\displaystyle\\tilde{w}_{0} \\displaystyle=1-\\tilde{w}_{1}-\\tilde{w}_{2}=-1.08. (c)​In the market portfolio it must hold that w_{1}^{M}+w_{2}^{M}=1 , i,e. w_{0}^{M}=0 . Therefore, we are looking for (1-\\gamma) such that (1-\\gamma)(w_{1}+w_{2})=1\\Leftrightarrow(1-\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{0.89-0.37}=1.92. Therefore, \\displaystyle w_{1}^{M} \\displaystyle=-0.36\\cdot 1.92=-0.71 \\displaystyle w_{2}^{M} \\displaystyle=0.89\\cdot 1.92=1.71. Problem 2.6. Solve Question 3 from Problem Sheet 8, for the logarithmic utility function (i.e. u(x)=\\ln(x) ). Solution From Question 3, we have r=\\frac{1}{9} , S_{0}=5 , S_{1}(\\omega_{1})=\\frac{20}{3} , S_{1}(\\omega_{2})=\\frac{40}{9} , \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})=\\frac{3}{5} and \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2})=\\frac{2}{5} . We first obtain u^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{1}{x} and therefore u^{\\prime}(I(x))=x\\Leftrightarrow\\frac{1}{I(x)}=x\\Leftrightarrow I(x)=\\frac{1}% {x}. Since u=\\frac{\\frac{20}{3}}{5}=\\frac{4}{3}>\\frac{10}{9}=1+r>\\frac{8}{9}=\\frac{\\frac{% 40}{9}}{5}=d , the market is arbitrage free and complete, and we can use the two-step approach. Step 1:​Find \\mathbb{Q} : q=\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}=\\frac{1}{2}=\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{1}) and so \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{2})=\\frac{1}{2} . The State-Price density is therefore \\displaystyle L(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{1})}{\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})}=\\frac{5}{6} \\displaystyle L(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{2})}{\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2})}=\\frac{5}{4}. We must now solve the system \\displaystyle W(\\omega_{i}) \\displaystyle=I(\\lambda\\frac{L(\\omega_{i})}{1+r}) \\displaystyle i=1,2 \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{1}{1+r}I(\\lambda\\frac{L}{1+r})) \\displaystyle=x. We start by solving the second equation with respect to \\lambda : \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{1}{1+r}I(\\lambda\\frac{L}{1+r})) \\displaystyle=x \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{1}{\\lambda L}) \\displaystyle=x \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\left(\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{1})\\frac{\\mathbb{P}(% \\omega_{1})}{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{1})}+\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{2})\\frac{\\mathbb{P}(% \\omega_{2})}{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{2})}\\right) \\displaystyle=x \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\displaystyle=x \\displaystyle\\Updownarrow \\displaystyle\\lambda \\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{x}. Substituting \\lambda into the first equation, we get: W(\\omega_{i})=\\frac{(1+r)\\cdot x}{L(\\omega_{i})},\\quad i=1,2. Step 2:​We are solving the problem for the initial investment x=5 . The optimal attainable wealths are therefore \\displaystyle W(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{\\frac{10}{9}\\cdot 5}{\\frac{5}{6}}=\\frac{60}{9}, \\displaystyle W(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{\\frac{10}{9}\\cdot 5}{\\frac{5}{4}}=\\frac{40}{9}. We now find the replicating strategy for the above wealths, so we are solving the system \\displaystyle(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=W(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=W(\\omega_{2}). This yields \\phi=\\frac{\\frac{60-40}{9}}{\\frac{60-40}{9}}=1. The optimal strategy is therefore (x,\\phi)=(5,1) , or put into words, for the starting investment of 5 units of money, the optimal strategy is to buy one share of the stock and to invest 5-1\\cdot 5=0 into the money account.

Revision Sheet 2 (Investment) Revision Sheet 2 (Investment) Problem 2.1. The correlation \\rho between assets A and B is 0.1 . The other data is given in the following table: Asset \\bar{R} \\sigma A 10\\% 15\\% B 18\\% 30\\% (a)​Find the proportions \\alpha of A and (1-\\alpha) of B that define a portfolio of A and B having minimum standard deviation. (b)​What is the value of this minimum standard deviation? (c)​What is the expected return of this portfolio? Solution (a)​We first calculate the covariance as \\sigma_{AB}=\\rho\\sigma_{A}\\sigma_{B}=0.0045. We are therefore looking for the minimiser of \\mathcal{L}(\\alpha)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha^{2}\\sigma_{A}^{2}+(1-\\alpha)^{2}\\sigma_% {B}^{2}+2\\alpha(1-\\alpha)\\sigma_{AB}). Note: We could have set the proportions of the two assets independently and added the condition that their sum needs to be equal to 1. This would lead to the same solution once we substitute the condition into the remaining equations.

(c)​The expected return is \\bar{R}=\\alpha\\bar{R}^{A}+(1-\\alpha)\\bar{R}^{B}\\simeq 0.114. Problem 2.2. Two stocks are available. The corresponding expected rates of return are \\bar{R}^{1} and \\bar{R}^{2} . The corresponding variances and covariance are \\sigma_{1}^{2} , \\sigma_{2}^{2} and \\sigma_{12} . What percentages of the total investment should be invested in each of the two stocks to minimise the total variance of return of the resulting portfolio? What is the mean rate of return of this portfolio? Solution Let \\alpha be the proportion of wealth invested in the 1st asset. This problem is the same as the previous, with the actual values left in their full generality. We are therefore solving \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial\\alpha}=\\alpha\\sigma_{1}^{2}-(% 1-\\alpha)\\sigma_{2}^{2}+\\sigma_{12}-2\\alpha\\sigma_{12}=0, which gives the solution \\alpha=\\frac{\\sigma_{2}^{2}-\\sigma_{12}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{2}^{2}-2\\sigma% _{12}}. Consequently, 1-\\alpha=\\frac{\\sigma_{1}^{2}-\\sigma_{12}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{2}^{2}-2% \\sigma_{12}}.

Suppose there are n assets which are uncorrelated. You may invest in any one, or in any combination of them.

The mean-variance diagram, with mvp being the minimum variance portfolio and the red line depicting the efficient set. The assets must not necessarily be ordered in an increasing order and are presented here as such for clarity.

The corresponding Lagrangian is \\mathcal{L}(w_{i},\\lambda)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{2}\\sigma_{i}^{2})-% \\lambda(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}-1).

For the second equality, we calculate \\displaystyle\\hat{V}_{1}(x,\\phi) \\displaystyle=x-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\phi^{i}S_{0}^{i}+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\phi^{i}\\hat{S}_% {1}^{i} \\displaystyle=x+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\phi^{i}(\\hat{S}_{1}^{i}-S_{0}^{i})=x+\\sum_{i=1}% ^{n}\\phi^{i}\\Delta\\hat{S}^{i} \\displaystyle=x+\\hat{G}(x,\\phi)=V_{0}(x,\\phi)+\\hat{G}(x,\\phi)=\\hat{V}_{0}(x,% \\phi)+\\hat{G}(x,\\phi). Problem 2.2. Prove Proposition 1.2.6. (This is merely a reformulation of the definition of arbitrage; don’t be afraid!) Solution We first verify that the first of the two conditions is equivalent to the definition. Since V_{0}(x,\\phi)=\\hat{V}_{0}(x,\\phi) , the first condition holds by definition. The second condition of arbitrage also holds since 1+r>0 by assumption, so that when V_{1}(x,\\phi)\\geq 0 , \\hat{V}_{1}(x,\\phi)=V_{1}(x,\\phi)/(1+r)\\geq 0 as well and similarly in reverse. The final condition is equally satisfied for the same \\omega due to (1+r)>0 . The equivalence of the two conditions from Proposition 1.16. can be proven similarly since: \\hat{G}(x,\\phi)=\\hat{V}_{1}(0,\\phi) Remark: You will be able to solve the following 3 problems after our third lecture! Problem 2.3. Consider a model where \\Omega=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\} , r=\\frac{1}{9} , S_{0}=5 and S_{1}(\\omega) is given by the table: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} S_{1}^{1} \\frac{20}{3} \\frac{40}{9} \\frac{30}{9} Compute all risk neutral measures and all attainable contingent claims for this model. Is the model arbitrage free? Solution A risk-neutral probability measure should satisfy \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{i})=1 and \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r})=S_{0} or equivalently \\displaystyle q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3} \\displaystyle=1 \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1+r}(q_{1}S_{1}(\\omega_{1})+q_{2}S_{1}(\\omega_{2})+q_{3}% S_{1}(\\omega_{3})) \\displaystyle=S_{0} \\displaystyle q_{1}\\geq 0,q_{2}\\geq 0,q_{3}\\geq 0 This gives us \\displaystyle q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3} \\displaystyle=1 \\displaystyle\\frac{9}{10}(q_{1}\\frac{20}{3}+q_{2}\\frac{40}{9}+q_{3}\\frac{30}{9}) \\displaystyle=5 We substitute q_{3}=1-q_{2}-q_{1} into the second equation to get 6q_{1}+4q_{2}+3(1-q_{1}-q_{2})=5 i.e. \\displaystyle q_{3} \\displaystyle=1-q_{1}-q_{2} \\displaystyle 3q_{1}+q_{2} \\displaystyle=2 so q_{3}=2q_{1}-1 and q_{2}=2-q_{1} . If we write q_{1}=\\lambda , this gives \\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\lambda\\\\ 2-3\\lambda\\\\ 2\\lambda-1\\end{array}\\right) where the first line gives \\lambda>0 , the second that \\lambda<\\frac{2}{3} and the third \\lambda>\\frac{1}{2} , therefore \\lambda\\in(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{2}{3}) We therefore found an infinite number of risk neutral measures. The fundamental theorem of asset pricing tells us that the existence of a risk neutral measure guarantees no arbitrage. We now focus on finding all attainable contingent claims. Consider for example an option with payoff \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} S_{1}^{1} \\frac{20}{9} \\frac{10}{9} \\frac{5}{9} Let us find its price using the risk neutral measures: \\displaystyle x \\displaystyle=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{X}{1+r}) \\displaystyle=2\\lambda+(2-3\\lambda)+(2\\lambda-1)\\frac{1}{2} \\displaystyle=\\frac{3}{2}. Note that the price does not depend on \\lambda , i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the risk neutral measure. This makes the claim attainable (i.e. there exists a replicating strategy). In general, a claim is attainable if \\displaystyle(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=X(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=X(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle(x-\\phi S_{0})(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}(\\omega_{3}) \\displaystyle=X(\\omega_{3}) This can be rewritten as \\phi\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\Delta\\hat{S}(\\omega_{1})\\\\ \\Delta\\hat{S}(\\omega_{2})\\\\ \\Delta\\hat{S}(\\omega_{3})\\end{array}\\right)+x\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{1}{1+r}\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}X(\\omega_{1})\\\\ X(\\omega_{2})\\\\ X(\\omega_{3})\\end{array}\\right), with x,\\phi\\in\\mathbb{R} . The space of attainable claims is therefore \\displaystyle T \\displaystyle:=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}:\\phi\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ -1\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right)+x\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{1}{1+r}\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right),\\phi,x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\} \\displaystyle=\\operatorname{Span}(\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ -1\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right),\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right)) Problem 2.4. Compute \\mathbb{W} and \\mathbb{W}^{\\bot} for the model in Problem 2.3. Solution We know from the previous question that \\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\Delta\\hat{S}(\\omega_{1})\\\\ \\Delta\\hat{S}(\\omega_{2})\\\\ \\Delta\\hat{S}(\\omega_{3})\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ -1\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right). By definition \\mathbb{W}=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}|x=\\hat{G}(x,\\phi),\\phi\\in\\mathbb{R}\\} and \\hat{G}(x,\\phi)=\\phi\\Delta\\hat{S}=\\phi\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ -1\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right). Therefore \\mathbb{W}=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}|x=\\phi\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ -1\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right),\\phi\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}. \\displaystyle\\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} \\displaystyle=\\{Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}|\\langle Y,X\\rangle=0,X\\in\\mathbb{W}\\} \\displaystyle=\\{Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}|Y_{1}-Y_{2}-2Y_{3}=0\\} Recall that \\mathbb{W}^{\\perp}\\cap\\mathcal{P}^{+} is the set of all risk-neutral measures, so that any triple from \\mathbb{W}^{\\perp} that also represents a strictly positive probability measure is a risk-neutral measure. Problem 2.5. Consider a market model with two stocks, a money market account and four possible states of the world: \\Omega=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\} . The risk free interest rate is equal to r=20\\% . Prices of both stocks at time t=0 are equal to 1 . The prices at time t=1 are given by the following table: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} \\omega_{4} S_{1}^{1} 4 1 3 1 S_{1}^{2} 1.2 0.2 1.2 2 •​Find the set of risk neutral probability measures. •​Find the set of attainable contingent claims for the model. Solution Let the risk neutral measure be \\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}q_{1}\\\\ q_{2}\\\\ q_{3}\\\\ q_{4}\\end{array}\\right) . We look for all \\mathbb{Q} that satisfy \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\Delta\\hat{S}^{1}) \\displaystyle=0 \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\Delta\\hat{S}^{2}) \\displaystyle=0 This is equivalent to the three equations \\displaystyle 4q_{1}+q_{2}+3q_{3}+q_{4} \\displaystyle=1.2 \\displaystyle 1.2q_{1}+0.2q_{2}+1.2q_{3}+2q_{4} \\displaystyle=1.2 \\displaystyle q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+q_{4} \\displaystyle=1 If we write this as a matrix and diagonalise it we get \\displaystyle\\left(\\begin{array}[]{cccc|c}1&1&1&1&1\\\\ 4&1&3&1&1.2\\\\ 1.2&0.2&1.2&2&1.2\\end{array}\\right) \\displaystyle\\sim\\left(\\begin{array}[]{cccc|c}1&1&1&1&1\\\\ 0&-3&-1&-3&-2.8\\\\ 0&-1&0&0.8&0\\end{array}\\right) \\displaystyle\\sim\\left(\\begin{array}[]{cccc|c}1&1&1&1&1\\\\ 0&1&\\frac{1}{3}&1&\\frac{2.8}{3}\\\\ 0&0&\\frac{1}{3}&1.8&\\frac{2.8}{5}\\end{array}\\right) From the last row we get that q_{3}=2.8-5.4q_{4} . Row 2 gives q_{2}=0.8q_{4} and Row 1 gives q_{1}=-1.8+2.6q_{4} , so \\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}-1.8+3.6\\lambda\\\\ 0.8\\lambda\\\\ 2.8-5.4\\lambda\\\\ \\lambda\\end{array}\\right) Since all q_{i} need to be positive, this gives that \\lambda\\in(0.5,0.5185) . We next look for all attainable claims. By repeating the steps from the previous question we get T:=\\operatorname{Span}(\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right),\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\frac{28}{12}\\\\ -\\frac{2}{12}\\\\ \\frac{18}{12}\\\\ -\\frac{2}{12}\\end{array}\\right),\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}0\\\\ -\\frac{10}{12}\\\\ 0\\\\ \\frac{8}{12}\\end{array}\\right)) Numerical solutions P2.3: \\mathbb{Q}=(\\lambda,2-3\\lambda,2\\lambda-1)^{T} , \\lambda\\in(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{2}{3}) .

Problem Sheet 3 Problem Sheet 3 This sheet will be discussed in the seminar on Friday, 18th October 2024. The solutions will be discussed in the seminar 1 week later. Problem 3.1.

Problem 3.2. Consider a one-period market model consisting of a bond and a stock with the following prices. •​At time 0: B_{0}^{1}=1\\quad and\\quad S_{0}^{2}=4 •​At time 1: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} B_{1}^{1} 1 1 1 S_{1}^{2} 6 4 3 (a)​Explain briefly why the interest rate is equal to 0%. (b)​Compute the set of risk neutral measures for this model. (c)​Is this market arbitrage-free? Explain your answer. (d)​Is this model complete? Give an explanation.

This product has a payoff: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} S_{1}^{3} 0 1 1.5 Show that it is an attainable claim. Solution (a)​ B_{1}=(1+r)B_{0} if and only if r=0 . (b)​We are solving the system of two equations with 3 unknowns: \\displaystyle q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3} \\displaystyle=1 \\displaystyle 6q_{1}+4q_{2}+3q_{3} \\displaystyle=4. Substituting q_{3} from the first equation into the second, we get \\displaystyle q_{3} \\displaystyle=1-q_{1}-q_{2} \\displaystyle q_{2} \\displaystyle=1-3q_{1}, and substituting q_{2} from the second equation into the first yields \\displaystyle\\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\lambda\\\\ 1-3\\lambda\\\\ 2\\lambda\\end{array}\\right). Here, \\lambda>0 due to the first entry and \\lambda<1/3 due to the second entry, so \\lambda\\in(0,1/3) (c)​Yes, the fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that if at least one risk-neutral measure exists, then there is no arbitrage.

Approach 2:​We calculate \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{1}^{3}}{1+r})=0\\lambda+(1-3\\lambda)+2\\lambda% \\frac{3}{2}=1. Since the price does not depend on \\lambda , the claim is attainable.

In this model consider a call option with the strike price K=\\frac{50}{9} , i.e. X=(S_{1}-K)^{+} . Compute the set of all prices of this option that comply with the no arbitrage principle. Solution The payout of X is \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} X \\frac{10}{9} 0 0 Recall that \\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\lambda\\\\ 2-3\\lambda\\\\ 2\\lambda-1\\end{array}\\right), with \\lambda\\in(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{2}{3}) .

Problem Sheet 4 Problem Sheet 4 This sheet will be discussed in the seminar on Friday, 25th October 2024. The solutions will be discussed in the seminar 1 week later. Remark: You will be able to solve the following 2 problems after our fifth lecture! You can already attempt Problem 4.2 (b) and think about (c). Problem 4.1. In the context of a multiperiod market model with t=0,\\ldots,T show that if there exists a trading strategy \\phi=(\\phi_{t})_{0\\leq t\\leq T} and t^{*}\\leq T such that (1)​ V_{0}(\\phi)=0 (2)​ V_{t^{*}}(\\phi)\\geq 0 (3)​ \\mathbb{E}(V_{t^{*}}(\\phi))>0 then there exists an arbitrage. Hint: construct an arbitrage from the given trading strategy. Solution We require (1)​ V_{0}(\\phi)=0 , (2)​ V_{T}(\\phi)\\geq 0 , (3)​ \\mathbb{E}(V_{T}(\\phi))>0 . To build the arbitrage, do the following: •​Follow the arbitrage strategy \\phi from t=0 to t=t^{*} . •​At t=t^{*} , cash in the arbitrage opportunity and invest it all in the riskless asset (i.e. the money market account). Therefore, for t\\geq t^{*} , \\phi_{t}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}V_{t^{*}}/B_{t^{*}}\\\\ 0\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right). By definition of the arbitrage strategy, there exists an \\omega\\in\\Omega such that V_{t^{*}}(\\phi)(\\omega)>0 and therefore \\phi_{t} above is not identically equal 0 for at least one \\omega . At time T , the value of \\phi is equal to \\displaystyle V_{T}(\\phi)=\\frac{V_{t^{*}}}{B_{t^{*}}}B_{t^{*}}(1+r)^{T-t^{*}}=% V_{t^{*}}(1+r)^{T-t^{*}}\\geq 0 and V_{T}(\\phi)>0 on at least one \\omega by the above. Problem 4.2. Consider a market model with T=2 , i.e. t=0,1,2 , and riskless interest rate r=\\frac{1}{4} , and one risky asset whose prices are described by the following diagram: (a)​Compute the probability measure \\mathbb{P} for the model using the probability values on the arrows. (b)​Find a filtration generated by the asset prices.

Solution (a) \\displaystyle\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=\\mathbb{P}(S_{1}=8\\,\\&\\,S_{2}=9) \\displaystyle=\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1}|\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\})\\mathbb{P}(\\{% \\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\})+\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1}|\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4},\\omega_% {5}\\})\\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4},\\omega_{5}\\}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{2}{5}+0\\frac{3}{5}=\\frac{3}{10} \\displaystyle\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{2}{5}\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{10} \\displaystyle\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{3}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{2}{7}=\\frac{6}{35} \\displaystyle\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{4}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{2}{7}=\\frac{6}{35} \\displaystyle\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{5}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{3}{7}=\\frac{9}{35} ​We also calculate for later use B_{0}=1\\rightarrow B_{1}=\\frac{5}{4}\\rightarrow B_{2}=\\frac{25}{16} (b)​At t=0 , S_{0}=5 is constant in all \\Omega . Consequently, A_{0}=\\{\\Omega\\} and \\mathcal{F}_{0}=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\} . At t=1 , S_{1}=\\begin{cases}8&\\text{for }\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\}\\\\ 4&\\text{for }\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4},\\omega_{5}\\}\\end{cases} . The resulting partition of \\Omega is A_{1}^{1}=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\} and A_{1}^{2}=\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4},\\omega_{5}\\} . The sigma algebra generated by S_{1} is therefore \\mathcal{G}_{1}=\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\},\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4},% \\omega_{5}\\},\\Omega\\} . Since \\mathcal{F}_{0}\\subset\\mathcal{G}_{1} , we have that \\mathcal{G}_{1}=\\mathcal{F}_{1} . At t=2 , S_{2}=\\begin{cases}9&\\text{for }\\omega_{1}\\\\ 6&\\text{for }\\{\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\}\\\\ 4&\\text{for }\\omega_{4}\\\\ 3&\\text{for }\\omega_{5}\\end{cases} . The partition for \\mathcal{G}_{2} is therefore \\{\\omega_{1}\\} , \\{\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\} , \\{\\omega_{4}\\} and \\{\\omega_{5}\\} . To get the filtration at t=2 , we need to combine \\mathcal{F}_{1} and \\mathcal{G}_{2} . The only partition that can reproduce all partition sets of \\mathcal{F}_{1} and \\mathcal{G}_{2} is A_{2}^{1}=\\{\\omega_{1}\\},A_{2}^{2}=\\{\\omega_{2}\\},A_{2}^{3}=\\{\\omega_{3}\\},A_{% 2}^{4}=\\{\\omega_{4}\\},A_{2}^{5}=\\{\\omega_{5}\\} and so \\mathcal{F}_{2}=\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) . (c)​The first strategy is not adapted since \\phi^{1} is not constant on \\Omega at t=0 . The second strategy is not adapted since \\phi^{0} is not constant on the sets \\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\} and \\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4},\\omega_{5}\\} at t=1 . The third strategy is adapted, since it is constant on all partition sets of \\mathcal{F}_{0} and \\mathcal{F}_{1} . (d)​We will modify the values of \\phi^{0} at time t=1 to ensure the strategy is self financing. We have that V_{0}(\\phi)=\\phi_{0}^{0}B_{0}+\\phi_{0}^{1}S_{0}=2\\cdot 1-1\\cdot 5=-3. In order to be self financing, we require that V_{1}(\\phi)^{-}=V_{1}(\\phi)^{+} , i.e. \\phi_{0}^{0}B_{1}+\\phi_{0}^{1}S_{1}=\\phi_{1}^{0}B_{1}+\\phi_{1}^{1}S_{1}. On \\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\} , this translates to \\displaystyle\\phi_{0}^{0}(1+r)+\\phi_{0}^{1}S_{1}(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=\\phi_{1}^{0}(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2})(1+r)+\\phi_{1}^{1}(\\omega_{1}% ,\\omega_{2})S_{1}(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle 2\\frac{5}{4}-1\\cdot 8 \\displaystyle=\\phi_{1}^{0}(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2})\\frac{5}{4}-\\frac{5}{2}8, so \\phi_{1}^{0}(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2})=\\frac{58}{5} .

Problem Sheet 5 Problem Sheet 5 This sheet will be discussed in the seminar on Friday, 1st November 2024. The solutions will be discussed in the seminar 1 week later. Problem 5.1. Consider a market model with a money market account with one-period interest rate equal to 20\\% and a risky asset whose prices are given by the following diagram: (a)​What are the dynamics of the money market account, i.e. find values for B_{0} , B_{1} and B_{2} . (b)​Recall that a multiperiod contingent claim is a random variable X representing the payoff at t=2 . Find the payoffs, i.e. the random variables X , for the following options: •​a call option with the strike price K equal to 5 , •​a put option with the strike price equal to 5 , •​a binary put option with the strike price equal to 4.2 . (c)​Try to calculate a hedging strategy for the binary put option with strike price equal to 4.2 . (d)​Is this market model complete? Solution (a) \\displaystyle B_{0}=1,\\quad B_{1}=(1+r)B_{0}=1.2,\\quad B_{2}=(1+r)^{2}B_{0}=1.% 44. (b)​Note first that \\displaystyle X^{C} \\displaystyle=(S_{2}-5)^{+}, \\displaystyle X^{P} \\displaystyle=(5-S_{2})^{+}, \\displaystyle X^{BP} \\displaystyle=\\begin{cases}1,&S_{2}\\leq 4.2\\\\ 0,&S_{2}>4.2\\end{cases}. We have therefore that the payoffs are as follows: \\Omega X^{C} X^{P} X^{BP} \\omega_{1} 4 0 0 \\omega_{2} 1 0 0 \\omega_{3} 1 0 0 \\omega_{4} 0 1 1 \\omega_{5} 0 2 1 (c)​In the lower branch of the tree we are solving the system of equations \\displaystyle\\phi_{0}^{1}1.2^{2}+\\phi_{1}^{1}6 \\displaystyle=0 \\displaystyle\\phi_{0}^{1}1.2^{2}+\\phi_{1}^{1}4 \\displaystyle=1 \\displaystyle\\phi_{0}^{1}1.2^{2}+\\phi_{1}^{1}3 \\displaystyle=1. The second and third equations yields \\phi_{1}^{1}=0 and therefore \\phi_{1}^{0}=\\frac{1}{1.2^{2}} . Checking whether this solution satisfies the first equation we get 1+0=0, which is a contradiction. It follows that no replicating strategy exists. (d)​No, the market is not complete. We know this since we have an unattainable claim X^{BP} (we verified this in the previous task) and therefore the market cannot be complete (by definition of completeness). Problem 5.2. Consider a market model with T=2 , i.e. t=0,1,2 , and riskless interest rate r=\\frac{1}{4} , and one risky asset whose prices are described by the following diagram: (Do not use decimal approximations in calculations.) (a)​Compute a hedge for a European Put option with the strike price equal to K=5 . (b)​What is the price one has to pay for this option at the moment t=0 ? (c)​What would be a fair price for this option to be paid at t=1 ? Is it a deterministic value or a random variable? (d)​Show that the hedging strategy you calculated is self-financing. Solution (a)​We first calculate the payoff of the put option: \\Omega X^{P} \\omega_{1} 0 \\omega_{2} 0 \\omega_{3} 0 \\omega_{4} 2 The replicating strategy at the node S_{1}=8 can be quickly calculated to satisfy (\\phi^{0}_{1},\\phi^{1}_{1})=(0,0) . This also gives us that the value at this node is x_{1}=0 . At the node S_{1}=4 we need to solve the system \\displaystyle\\phi^{0}_{1}(1+r)^{2}+\\phi_{1}^{1}6 \\displaystyle=0, \\displaystyle\\phi^{0}_{1}(1+r)^{2}+\\phi_{1}^{1}3 \\displaystyle=2. Solving this system we get that \\phi_{1}^{1}=\\frac{0-2}{6-3}=-\\frac{2}{3} and consequently \\phi_{1}^{0}=4\\cdot\\frac{16}{25} . The value at this node is therefore x_{1}=\\phi_{1}^{0}(1+r)+\\phi_{1}^{1}4=\\frac{8}{15} . Remark 1: Note that the replicating strategy at this node requires us to hold a negative amount of the underlying stock and a positive amount of the risk free asset. This is because the payoff of the put option (at this node) increases if the stock price falls, so we are required to hold a negative amount of the stock to hedge this fall. For a call option, this would be reversed - the payoff of a call option tends to increase if the underlying stock increases in value, so a hedging strategy will therefore have to hold a positive amount of the stock so that the two move in the same direction. Remark 2: The above remark holds for holding long positions of the option. When shorting, the reverse becomes true. For example, a hedging strategy for a short position in a European put option will require a positive amount of the stock, since a fall in the stock price increases the value of the put, and since we are shorting the put our losses would therefore increase. Put simply, a short in a put loses more money if the stock value drops, so to hedge against it we need to hold a positive amount of stock so that our hedge moves in the same direction as the stock. We now proceed to calculate the replicating strategy at the node S_{0}=5 , using the values we have calculated at the previous two nodes. We are therefore solving the system of equations \\displaystyle\\phi^{0}_{0}(1+r)+\\phi_{0}^{1}8 \\displaystyle=0, \\displaystyle\\phi^{0}_{0}(1+r)+\\phi_{0}^{1}4 \\displaystyle=\\frac{8}{15}. Calculating as before, we get \\phi_{0}^{1}=\\frac{-\\frac{8}{15}}{8-4}=-\\frac{2}{15} and \\phi_{0}^{0}=\\frac{64}{75} . Calculating the value of this strategy at time t=0 we get x_{0}=\\phi_{0}^{0}+\\phi_{0}^{1}5=\\frac{14}{75}\\sim 0.187. Note that the comment and argument from Remark 1 applies here as well. (b)​The price of the option at t=0 is x_{0}=0.187 as calculated above. (c)​The price at t=1 is a random variable, depending on which node we are in. The price is therefore x_{1}=\\begin{cases}0,&\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\}\\\\ \\frac{8}{15},&\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\}\\end{cases}. (d)​We need to check that at each node, no money is entering or leaving the system: At node S_{1}=8 we have \\phi_{0}^{0}(1+r)+\\phi_{0}^{1}8=0, which matches the value of x_{1} at this node. At the node S_{1}=4 we have \\phi_{0}^{0}(1+r)+\\phi_{0}^{1}4=\\frac{8}{15}, which matches the value x_{1} at this node. Numerical solutions P5.1: (a) B_{0}=1 , B_{1}=(1+r)B_{0}=1.2 , B_{2}=(1+r)^{2}B_{0}=1.44 . (b) X^{C}=(4,1,1,0,0)^{T} , X^{P}=(0,0,0,1,2)^{T} , X^{BP}=(0,0,0,1,1)^{T} . P5.2: (b) x_{0}\\sim 0.187 .

Consider a three period market model with the riskless interest rate equal to 25\\% (in every period) and one risky asset whose dynamics are given by the table (together with the physical measure \\mathbb{P} ): \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} \\omega_{4} \\omega_{5} \\omega_{6} \\omega_{7} \\omega_{8} \\mathbb{P} 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 S_{0} 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 S_{1} 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 S_{2} 8 8 7 7 7 7 3 3 S_{3} 12 7 10 7 8 3 6 1 (a)​Find the filtration generated by the asset prices. (b)​Compute the set of risk neutral measures. (c)​Decide whether the market model is arbitrage free. (d)​Construct a tree representing the dynamics of the risky asset. Remember the probabilities on the arrows. Solution We start by drawing the tree in order to help us visualise the process. (a)​At t=0 we have \\mathcal{F}_{0}=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}. At t=1 , the filtration is \\mathcal{F}_{1}=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega,\\underbrace{\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_% {3},\\omega_{4}\\}}_{A_{1}^{1}},\\underbrace{\\{\\omega_{5},\\omega_{6},\\omega_{7},% \\omega_{8}\\}}_{A_{1}^{2}},\\}. At t=2 , the \\sigma -algebra is generated by the set \\{\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\},\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4},\\omega_{5},\\omega_{6}\\},\\{% \\omega_{7},\\omega_{8}\\},\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\},\\{% \\omega_{5},\\omega_{6},\\omega_{7},\\omega_{8}\\}\\}, which has the partition set A_{2}^{1}=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\},A_{2}^{2}=\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\},A_{2}^% {3}=\\{\\omega_{5},\\omega_{6}\\},A_{2}^{4}=\\{\\omega_{7},\\omega_{8}\\}. At t=3 , the \\sigma -algebra is generated by the set \\displaystyle\\{\\{\\omega_{1}\\},\\{\\omega_{2},\\omega_{4}\\},\\{\\omega_{3}\\},\\{% \\omega_{5}\\},\\{\\omega_{6}\\},\\{\\omega_{7}\\},\\{\\omega_{8}\\},\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_% {2}\\},\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\},\\{\\omega_{5},\\omega_{6}\\},\\{\\omega_{7},\\omega_% {8}\\}\\}, for which the partition is \\{\\{\\omega_{1}\\},\\{\\omega_{2}\\},\\{\\omega_{3}\\},\\{\\omega_{4}\\},\\{\\omega_{5}\\},% \\{\\omega_{6}\\},\\{\\omega_{7}\\},\\{\\omega_{8}\\}\\}, so that \\mathcal{F}_{3}=\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) . (b)​The risk neutral measures are \\mathbb{Q}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}q_{1}\\\\ q_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ q_{8}\\end{array}\\right) satisfying: q_{1}+\\cdots+q_{8}=1. (6.1) Furthermore, they need to satisfy \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r}|\\mathcal{F}_{0})=S_{0}, i.e. \\frac{1}{1.25}((q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+q_{4})6+(q_{5}+q_{6}+q_{7}+q_{8})4)=4. (6.2) Next, it needs to hold that \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{2}}{1+r}|\\mathcal{F}_{1})=S_{1}, i.e. on A_{1}^{1} \\frac{1}{1.25}\\left(\\frac{q_{1}+q_{2}}{q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+q_{4}}8+\\frac{q_{3}+q% _{4}}{q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+q_{4}}7\\right)=6 (6.3) and on A_{1}^{2} \\frac{1}{1.25}\\left(\\frac{q_{1}+q_{2}}{q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+q_{4}}7+\\frac{q_{3}+q% _{4}}{q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+q_{4}}3\\right)=4. (6.4) From \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{S_{3}}{1+r}|\\mathcal{F}_{2})=S_{2} we get the 4 equations \\frac{1}{1.25}\\left(\\frac{q_{1}}{q_{1}+q_{2}}12+\\frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}+q_{2}}7% \\right)=8 (6.5) \\frac{1}{1.25}\\left(\\frac{q_{3}}{q_{3}+q_{4}}10+\\frac{q_{3}}{q_{3}+q_{4}}7% \\right)=7 (6.6) \\frac{1}{1.25}\\left(\\frac{q_{5}}{q_{5}+q_{6}}8+\\frac{q_{6}}{q_{5}+q_{6}}3% \\right)=7 (6.7) \\frac{1}{1.25}\\left(\\frac{q_{7}}{q_{7}+q_{8}}6+\\frac{q_{8}}{q_{7}+q_{8}}1% \\right)=3 (6.8) If we tried to solve this system of 8 equations with 8 unknowns, we would obtain no solutions, telling us there is no risk neutral measure. A quicker way to convince ourselves that that is the case, is trying to find the risk-neutral probabilities (recall that these are the conditional probabilities) on the arrows in the tree. We get at the very top branch S_{2}=8 that the risk neutral (conditional) probability has to satisfy q^{*}=\\frac{1+r-d^{*}}{u^{*}-d^{*}}=\\frac{1.25-\\frac{7}{8}}{\\frac{12}{8}-\\frac% {7}{8}}=\\frac{3}{5}, which would be ok. If we however consider the node S_{2}=7 in the lower half of the tree (i.e. on \\{\\omega_{5},\\omega_{6}\\} ), we get \\tilde{q}=\\frac{1.25-\\frac{3}{7}}{\\frac{8}{7}-\\frac{3}{7}}=\\frac{23}{20}>1 which is not a (conditional) probability, so a risk neutral measure cannot exists at least on this branch of the tree and therefore not for the whole tree. (c)​The market is not arbitrage free due to the Fundamental theorem of asset pricing, since no risk-neutral measure exists. (d)​We calculate the probabilities on the arrows. Starting with the two top most states of the tree, we have the two equations \\displaystyle\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=p_{1}p_{2}^{1}p_{3}^{1}=0.5^{3}, \\displaystyle\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=p_{1}p_{2}^{1}(1-p_{3}^{1})=0.5^{3}. Dividing them we obtain \\frac{p_{3}^{1}}{1-p_{3}^{1}}=1\\Leftrightarrow p_{3}^{1}=0.5. A similar calculation across all branches gives us that all probabilities are equal to 0.5 . Problem 6.2. Fill a table with asset prices at t=0,1,2 (as in the above exercise) for the risky asset whose prices are described by the following diagram: Solution We calculate from the arrows \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})=\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=0.3, \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2})=\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=0.1, \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{3})=\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{7}=\\frac{6}{35}, and \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{4})=\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{5}{7}=\\frac{15}{35}. The resulting table is \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} \\omega_{4} \\mathbb{P} 0.3 0.1 \\frac{6}{35} \\frac{15}{35} S_{0} 5 5 5 5 S_{1} 8 8 4 4 S_{2} 12 6 6 3 Problem 6.3. Show that if \\phi is an adapted and self-financing trading strategy and \\mathbb{Q} is a risk neutral measure, then \\hat{V}_{s}(\\phi)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\big{(}\\hat{V}_{t}(\\phi)|\\mathcal{F}_% {s}\\big{)},\\qquad 0\\leq s\\leq t\\leq T.

Show that the following Utility Functions satisfy the properties 1-3 from Definition 3.1.1 in the Notes. Calculate the coefficients of risk aversion (absolute and relative). (a)​ u(x)=5\\ln(x) . (b)​ u(x)={x}^{1/3} (it is an example of the power utility function). Solution (a)​We consider u(x)=5\\ln(x) with x>0 . The first derivative is u^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{5}{x}>0 , still for x>0 , so condition 2 is satisfied. The second derivative is u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=-\\frac{5}{x^{2}}<0 for x>0 and so the 3rd condition is satisfied. Furthermore, \\lim_{x\\downarrow 0}u^{\\prime}(x)=\\lim_{x\\downarrow 0}\\frac{5}{x}=\\infty and \\lim_{x\\uparrow\\infty}u^{\\prime}(x)=\\lim_{x\\uparrow\\infty}\\frac{5}{x}=0, so condition 1 holds. We next calculate the two coefficients of risk aversion: \\alpha(x)=-\\frac{u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{u^{\\prime}(x)}=-\\frac{-\\frac{5}{x^{2}}}{% \\frac{5}{x}}=\\frac{1}{x}, which shows decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA). r(x)=-\\frac{xu^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{u^{\\prime}(x)}=1, which shows a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). (b)​We repeat the above for u(x)=x^{1/3} . This gives us: u^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3}>0,\\quad x>0 and therefore u is increasing. u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=-\\frac{2}{9}x^{-5/3}<0,\\quad x>0 and thus u is concave. \\lim_{x\\downarrow 0}u^{\\prime}(x)=\\lim_{x\\downarrow 0}\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}=\\infty and \\lim_{x\\uparrow\\infty}u^{\\prime}(x)=\\lim_{x\\uparrow\\infty}\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}=0 and consequently condition 1 holds. Finally, \\alpha(x)=-\\frac{-\\frac{2}{9}x^{-5/3}}{\\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3}}=\\frac{2}{3}x^{-1} and r(x)=\\frac{2}{3}, so we again have DARA and CRRA. Problem 7.2. Derive a formula for the arbitrage free price at time t=0 for the European put option with payoff X=(K-S_{T})^{+} in the binomial market model with parameters u=d^{-1} , r , T . Solution The price of the option at t=0 will be given by V_{0}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{1}{(1+r)^{T}}X)=\\frac{1}{(1+r)^{T}}\\sum_{k% =0}^{T}{T\\choose k}q^{k}(1-q)^{T-k}\\max\\{0,K-S_{0}u^{k}d^{T-k}\\}. The payoff is non-zero when K-S_{0}u^{k}d^{T-k}>0 , which is equivalent to k<\\frac{\\log(\\frac{K}{S_{0}d^{T}})}{\\log(\\frac{u}{d})} . Let \\hat{k} be the largest integer for which this inequality holds.

Answer the following questions as precisely as possible. (a)​In the two-state single period model with \\Omega=\\{H,T\\} , S_{1}(H)=uS_{0} , S_{1}(T)=S_{0}d , where S_{0} is the initial stock value and d<1+r<u , show that \\tilde{P}(H)=\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d},\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ % \\tilde{P}(T)=\\frac{u-1-r}{u-d} is a risk-neutral probability measure. (b)​When is a contingent claim called attainable? In the general single-period market model, are all contingent claims attainable when the market is arbitrage-free? (c)​In a single period model with three states of the world ( \\Omega=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\} ), one stock and a money market account available, we are given the set \\mathbb{M} of risk neutral measures: \\mathbb{M}=\\{\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}\\lambda\\\\ 1-\\frac{3}{2}\\lambda\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda\\end{array}\\right),\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\lambda\\in(0,\\frac{2% }{3})\\}.

Solution (a)​We first check that \\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}(H)+\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}(T)=1 , which can quickly be verified to hold. We also have that \\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}(H)>0 and \\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}(T)>0 since d<1+r<u . It remains to show that this probability measure is risk neutral. We calculate \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}}(\\frac{S_{1}}{1+r}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{1+r}(\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}(H)S_{1}(H)+\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}}(T% )S_{1}(T)) \\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{1+r}(\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}S_{0}u+\\frac{u-1-r}{u-d}S_{0}d) \\displaystyle=\\frac{S_{0}}{1+r}(\\frac{u-ru-du+du-d-rd}{u-d}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{S_{0}}{1+r}\\frac{(u-d)(1+r)}{u-d} \\displaystyle=S_{0}. Note: This makes the discounted stock price a martingale (a stochastic process that in expectation maintains its value). (b)​A contingent claim is attainable if and only if there exists a replicating strategy. A market being arbitrage-free does not necessarily mean complete. Therefore, in a market that is arbitrage-free but not complete, not every contingent claim is attainable. (c)​This market is incomplete because we have more than 1 risk-neutral measure. We want to find a contingent claim that is attainable. This means that a replicating strategy exists for this claim, which is equivalent to the price of the claim being the same for all risk-neutral measures, i.e. the price must not depend on \\lambda . If we calculate the price of a general claim, it holds that \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{X}{1+r}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{1+r}(\\lambda X(\\omega_{1})+(1-\\frac{3}{2}\\lambda)X(% \\omega_{2})+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda X(\\omega_{3})) \\displaystyle=\\lambda\\frac{1}{1+r}(X(\\omega_{1})-\\frac{3}{2}X(\\omega_{2})+% \\frac{1}{2}X(\\omega_{3}))+\\frac{X(\\omega_{2})}{1+r}. Therefore, if X(\\omega_{1})-\\frac{3}{2}X(\\omega_{2})+\\frac{1}{2}X(\\omega_{3})=0 , the price does not depend on \\lambda and the claim is therefore attainable. (d)​As we’ve already seen before, the filtrations are \\displaystyle\\mathcal{F}_{0} \\displaystyle=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}, \\displaystyle\\mathcal{F}_{1} \\displaystyle=\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\},\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\},% \\Omega\\}, \\displaystyle\\mathcal{F}_{2} \\displaystyle=\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega). Problem 7.4. Assume that a stock with an initial price of S_{0} = 100 follows the binomial model with u=1.1 , d=0.9 over the next two periods. There is a European Call option with payoff X=(S_{2}-K)^{+} at time t=2 on this stock. The interest rate for one period is r=0.02 and interest is compounded continuously. (a)​Find the value at time 0 of this option as a function of the strike price K . (b)​Find a hedging strategy for the above call option with the strike K=100 . Justify why this strategy is adapted to the filtration generated by S_{t} . (Hint: Part (2) can be solved independently of (1)) Solution (a)​The price evolution of S can be seen in the following tree: We therefore get different payoffs depending on whether •​ K\\geq 121 : X=0 for all \\omega\\in\\Omega , •​ K<81 : X=\\begin{cases}121-K,&\\omega_{1}\\\\ 99-K,&\\omega_{2}\\\\ 99-K,&\\omega_{3}\\\\ 81-K,&\\omega_{4}\\end{cases} , •​ 81\\leq K<99 : X=\\begin{cases}121-K,&\\omega_{1}\\\\ 99-K,&\\omega_{2}\\\\ 99-K,&\\omega_{3}\\\\ 0,&\\omega_{4}\\end{cases} and •​ 99\\leq K<121 : X=\\begin{cases}121-K,&\\omega_{1}\\\\ 0,&\\omega_{2}\\\\ 0,&\\omega_{3}\\\\ 0,&\\omega_{4}\\end{cases} The evolution of the money market is B_{0}=1\\rightarrow B_{1}=e^{0.02}\\rightarrow B_{2}=e^{2\\cdot 0.002}. We can calculate q=\\frac{e^{0.02}-d}{u-d}=0.6010067 . We then get for •​ K\\geq 121 : X_{0}=0 , •​ K<81 : X_{0}=e^{-2\\cdot 0.02}(q^{2}(121-K)+2q(1-q)(99-K)+(1-q)^{2}(81-K)) , •​ 81\\leq K<99 : X_{0}=e^{-2\\cdot 0.02}(q^{2}(121-K)+2q(1-q)(99-K)) and •​ 99\\leq K<121 : X_{0}=e^{-2\\cdot 0.02}q^{2}(121-K) (b)​For K=100 the payoff is X=\\begin{cases}21,&\\omega_{1}\\\\ 0,&\\omega_{2}\\\\ 0,&\\omega_{3}\\\\ 0,&\\omega_{4}\\end{cases} . The replicating strategy will trivially hold 0 assets at the node S_{1}=90 and the corresponding value of the replicating strategy is also x_{B}=0 . At the node S_{1}=110 we calculate \\displaystyle\\phi_{A}^{0}B_{2}+\\phi_{A}^{1}S_{2}(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=X(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle\\phi_{A}^{0}B_{2}+\\phi_{A}^{1}S_{2}(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=X(\\omega_{2}) which is equivalent to \\displaystyle\\phi_{A}^{0}e^{0.04}+\\phi_{A}^{1}121 \\displaystyle=21 \\displaystyle\\phi_{A}^{0}e^{0.04}+\\phi_{A}^{1}99 \\displaystyle=0 This yields \\phi_{A}^{1}=\\frac{21}{22} and \\phi_{A}^{0}=-90.7946 . The value of the replicating strategy at this node is x_{A}=\\phi_{A}^{0}e^{0.02}+\\phi_{A}^{1}110=12.37 At the node S_{0}=100 , we get using the above values the system \\displaystyle\\phi_{C}^{0}B_{1}+\\phi_{C}^{1}S_{1}(\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=x_{A} \\displaystyle\\phi_{C}^{0}B_{1}+\\phi_{C}^{1}S_{1}(\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}) \\displaystyle=x_{B} which is equivalent to \\displaystyle\\phi_{C}^{0}e^{0.02}+\\phi_{C}^{1}110 \\displaystyle=12.37 \\displaystyle\\phi_{C}^{0}e^{0.02}+\\phi_{C}^{1}90 \\displaystyle=0 which gives \\phi_{C}^{1}=0.6186 and \\phi_{C}^{0}=-54.56 . The value x_{C}=\\phi_{C}^{0}1+\\phi_{C}^{1}100=7.2870 . The filtration is \\displaystyle\\mathcal{F}_{0} \\displaystyle=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}, \\displaystyle\\mathcal{F}_{1} \\displaystyle=\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\},\\{\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\},% \\Omega\\}, \\displaystyle\\mathcal{F}_{2} \\displaystyle=\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega). Our trading strategy satisfies the following: \\phi_{0}^{0}=\\phi_{C}^{0}=-54.56 is constant on all of \\Omega . Likewise \\phi_{0}^{1}=\\phi_{C}^{1}=0.6186 is constant on all of \\Omega . \\phi_{1}^{0}=\\begin{cases}\\phi_{A}^{0}=-90.97,&\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\\\ \\phi_{B}^{0}=0,&\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\end{cases} is constant on the partition sets of \\mathcal{F}_{1} , as is \\phi_{1}^{1}=\\begin{cases}\\phi_{A}^{1}=\\frac{21}{22},&\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\\\ \\phi_{B}^{1}=0,&\\omega_{3},\\omega_{4}\\end{cases} . The strategy is therefore constant on each partition set of \\mathcal{F}_{t},t=0,1 , so it is adapted. Numerical solutions P7.1: (a) \\alpha(x)=\\frac{1}{x} , r(x)=1 .

Problem Sheet 8 Problem Sheet 8 This sheet will be discussed in the seminar on Friday, 22nd November 2024. The solutions will be discussed in the seminar 1 week later. Problem 8.1. Consider a (risk averse) utility function u:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\to\\mathbb{R} . Show that the inverse function I:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+} of the derivative u^{\\prime}:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+} is strictly decreasing and satisfies \\lim_{x\\to 0}I(x)=\\infty,\\qquad\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}I(x)=0. Hint: You may assume that u is twice differentiable. Solution Recall that I(x):=[u^{\\prime}(x)]^{-1} , so u^{\\prime}(I(x))=x and I(u^{\\prime}(x))=x . This in particular means that (u^{\\prime}(I(x)))^{\\prime}=x^{\\prime}, which is equivalent to u^{\\prime\\prime}(I(x))I^{\\prime}(x)=1. Expressing I^{\\prime}(x) from the above we have I^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{1}{u^{\\prime\\prime}(I(x))}<0, where the inequality follows since u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)<0 . Furthermore, \\lim_{x\\downarrow 0}I(x)=\\lim_{x\\uparrow\\infty}I(u^{\\prime}(x))=\\lim_{x% \\uparrow\\infty}x=\\infty, and similarly \\lim_{x\\uparrow\\infty}I(x)=\\lim_{x\\downarrow 0}I(u^{\\prime}(x))=\\lim_{x% \\downarrow 0}x=0. Problem 8.2. Compute the function I for the following utility functions: u(x)=\\log(x),\\qquad u(x)=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}x^{\\gamma},\\quad\\gamma\\in(0,1). For each of these functions calculate the coefficients of absolute and relative risk aversion and draw graphs of u , u^{\\prime} and I . Solution We begin with u(x)=\\log(x) . We have then u^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{1}{x} and u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=-\\frac{1}{x^{2}} . Setting u^{\\prime}(I(x))=x , this is equivalent to \\frac{1}{I(x)}=x , i.e. I(x)=\\frac{1}{x} . The coefficient of absolute risk aversion is then \\alpha(x)=-\\frac{u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{u^{\\prime}(x)}=\\frac{1}{x}\\quad\\text{(% DARA)} and the coefficient of relative risk aversion is r(x)=1\\quad\\text{(CRRA)}. The plots of u and u^{\\prime} (which is the same for I ) are in Figure 1. Refer to caption Refer to caption Figure 1. The plots for u(x)=\\ln(x) . We next consider u(x)=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}x^{\\gamma} , with \\gamma\\in(0,1) . We get u^{\\prime}(x)=x^{\\gamma-1} and u^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=(\\gamma-1)x^{\\gamma-2}<0 , where the latter holds since \\gamma<1 . To find the inverse, we want u^{\\prime}(I(x))=x , i.e. (I(x))^{\\gamma-1}=x . This gives that I(x)=x^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}} . Consequently, we have \\alpha(x)=-\\frac{(\\gamma-1)x^{\\gamma-2}}{x^{\\gamma-1}}=-(\\gamma-1)x^{-1}=\\frac% {1-\\gamma}{x}>0\\quad\\text{(DARA)} and r(x)=1-\\gamma\\quad\\text{(CRRA)}. The plots (for \\gamma=\\frac{1}{2} ) are in Figure 2. Refer to caption Refer to caption Refer to caption Figure 2. The plots for u(x)=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}x^{\\gamma} with \\gamma=\\frac{1}{2} . Problem 8.3. Consider a general single period market model with n=1 , k=2 , r=\\frac{1}{9} , S_{0}=5 , S_{1}(\\omega_{1})=\\frac{20}{3} , S_{1}(\\omega_{2})=\\frac{40}{9} and \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})=\\frac{3}{5} . Solve Step 1 of the optimal portfolio problem for the following utility function: u(x)=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}x^{\\gamma},\\quad\\gamma\\in(0,1). Remember that the solution depends on the initial investment x , i.e. x should be a parameter of the solution. Proceed now to Step 2: Find an optimal trading strategy for u(x)=3x^{1/3} and the initial investment equal to 5 . Solution Step 1:​We want to find W(\\omega_{1}) and W(\\omega_{2}) that maximise \\mathbb{E}(u(W)) , limiting ourselves to only attainable W . We know from the lecture that the method of Lagrange multipliers gives an equation for \\lambda \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\frac{1}{1+r}I(\\lambda\\frac{L}{1+r}))=x which we can then use to set W(\\omega_{i})=I(\\lambda\\frac{L(\\omega_{1})}{1+r}). In order to determine that L(\\omega_{i}) is, we first need to know \\mathbb{P} and \\mathbb{Q} . \\mathbb{P} is given in the exercise text, so it remains to find the risk neutral measure. Since our model is a single period two state model, we can use the (by now) well known formula q=\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}=\\frac{\\frac{10}{9}-\\frac{40/0}{5}}{\\frac{20/3}{5}-\\frac{40% /0}{5}}=\\frac{1}{2}. We therefore have that \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{1})=q=\\frac{1}{2} and \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{2})=1-q=\\frac{1}{2} . The state price density L is therefore given by \\displaystyle L(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{1})}{\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})}=\\frac{% \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{5}}=\\frac{5}{6}, \\displaystyle L(\\omega_{2}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{2})}{\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2})}=\\frac{% \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{2}{5}}=\\frac{5}{4}. To determine \\lambda , we need I(x) . Using the previous exercise, we know I(x)=x^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}} . This gives that \\lambda has to solve the equation \\frac{1}{1+r}\\left[q(\\lambda\\frac{L(\\omega_{1})}{1+r})^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}+(1% -q)(\\lambda\\frac{L(\\omega_{2})}{1+r})^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}\\right]=x. Expressing \\lambda , we get \\lambda^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}=\\frac{(1+r)x}{q(\\frac{L(\\omega_{1})}{1+r})^{\\frac% {1}{\\gamma-1}}+(1-q)(\\frac{L(\\omega_{2})}{1+r})^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}} (Note that although we have not plugged the numbers in yet, all of the above values are known). We are now ready to calculate what W is: \\displaystyle W(\\omega_{1}) \\displaystyle=I(\\lambda\\frac{L(\\omega_{1})}{1+r}) \\displaystyle=\\lambda^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}\\left(\\frac{L(\\omega_{1})}{1+r}% \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}} \\displaystyle=\\frac{(1+r)x\\left(\\frac{L(\\omega_{1})}{1+r}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{% \\gamma-1}}}{q(\\frac{L(\\omega_{1})}{1+r})^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}+(1-q)(\\frac{L(% \\omega_{2})}{1+r})^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}}} Using now \\gamma=\\frac{1}{3} , u(x)=3x^{\\frac{1}{3}} and x=5 , this gives W(\\omega_{1})=7.194773. A similar calculation gives W(\\omega_{2})=3.91634 . Step 2:​We are now ready to find a replicating strategy for W . The system we are solving is (x-S_{0}\\phi)(1+r)+\\phi S_{1}=W, which translates to the two equations \\displaystyle(5-5\\phi)\\frac{10}{9}+\\phi\\frac{20}{3} \\displaystyle=7.194773, \\displaystyle(5-5\\phi)\\frac{10}{9}+\\phi\\frac{40}{9} \\displaystyle=3.91634. This system has the solution \\phi=1.4753 . (Note that we had two equations, but only one unknown. The reason we knew the system would be solvable is because we are working in a complete market and we constructed W to be attainable with a starting investment of x=5 ). Numerical solutions P8.2: For \\log(x) , a(x)=\\frac{1}{x} and r(x)=1 . For \\frac{1}{\\gamma}x^{\\gamma} , a(x)=\\frac{1-\\gamma}{x} and r(x)=1-\\gamma . P8.3: For x=5 , W=(7.194773,3.91634) , (x,\\phi)=(5,1.4753) .

Problem Sheet 9 Problem Sheet 9 This sheet will be discussed in the seminar on Friday, 29th November 2024. The solutions will be discussed in the seminar 1 week later. Remark: You will be able to solve the following Problem 9.2 (f) after the Lecture on December 3rd. Problem 9.1. Consider the following single period market model with state space \\Omega=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\} . There are two stocks available. The initial stock prices are S_{0}^{1}=10 and S_{0}^{2}=6 . The stock prices evolve according to the following table: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} S_{1}^{1} 5 10 14 S_{1}^{2} 10 12 4 The probabilities of the states under the subjective measure \\mathbb{P} are assumed to be \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})=\\frac{3}{5} and \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2})=\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{3})=\\frac{1}{5} . (a)​Compute the expectation, the variance and the covariance matrix of the returns R^{1} and R^{2} of the stocks under the subjective probability measure. Hint: you need to compute the returns of the stocks first using the prices given. (b)​Assume that we can invest 1 unit of money to a portfolio consisting of F_{1} units of stock 1 and F_{2} units of stock 2. Calculate F_{1} , F_{2} so that the portfolio has minimum variance. What is the expected return of this portfolio? Solution (a)​We first calculate the corresponding returns: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} R^{1} -0.5 0 0.4 R^{2} 2/3 1 -1/3 \\mathbb{P} 3/5 1/5 1/5 The expected values are then \\mathbb{E}(R^{1})=\\frac{3}{5}(-0.5)+\\frac{1}{5}0+\\frac{1}{5}0.4=-0.22 and \\mathbb{E}(R^{2})=\\cdots=\\frac{8}{15}. The second moments are \\mathbb{E}((R^{1})^{2})_{=}\\frac{3}{5}(-0.5)^{2}+\\frac{1}{5}0^{2}+\\frac{1}{5}0% .4^{2}=0.182 and \\mathbb{E}((R^{2})^{2})=\\cdots=0.488. The variances are therefore \\operatorname{Var}(R^{1})=\\mathbb{E}((R^{1})^{2})-(\\mathbb{E}(R^{1}))^{2}=0.1336 and \\operatorname{Var}(R^{2})=0.2043. The covariance is \\displaystyle\\operatorname{Cov}(R^{1},R^{2}) \\displaystyle=\\mathbb{E}(R^{1}R^{2})-\\mathbb{E}(R^{1})\\mathbb{E}(R^{2}) \\displaystyle=\\frac{3}{5}(-0.5)\\frac{2}{3}+\\frac{1}{5}0\\cdot 1+\\frac{1}{5}0.4(% -\\frac{1}{3})-(-0.22)\\frac{8}{15} \\displaystyle=-0.1094. (b)​We are solving the problem \\displaystyle\\min_{w_{1},w_{2}}\\operatorname{Var}(R) \\displaystyle=w_{1}^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}\\sigma_{2}^{2}+2w_{1}w_{2}% \\sigma_{12}, s.t. \\displaystyle w_{1}+w_{2}=1. We solve this by finding the minimum of the Lagrange function L(w_{1},w_{2},\\lambda)=w_{1}^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}\\sigma_{2}^{2}+2w_{1}w% _{2}\\sigma_{12}-\\lambda(w_{1}+w_{2}-1), which can (in this case) be simplified by substituting w_{2}=1-w_{1} , which simplifies to finding the minimum of L(w_{1})=w_{1}^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+(1-w_{1})^{2}\\sigma_{2}^{2}+2w_{1}(1-w_{1})% \\sigma_{12}. Taking the derivative, we get \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{1}}=2w_{1}\\sigma_{1}^{2}-2(1-w_{1})\\sigma_{2}^{2% }+2(1-w_{1})\\sigma_{12}-2w_{1}\\sigma_{12}=0, which solving for w_{1} with the values of \\sigma_{1} , \\sigma_{2} and \\sigma_{12} substituted in gives w_{1}=0.5637,w_{2}=0.4363. The return of this a portfolio with these weights is \\mathbb{E}(R)=w_{1}\\mathbb{E}(R^{1})+w_{2}\\mathbb{E}(R^{2})=0.1087. To determine how many shares we buy, note that the investor invests the proportion w_{1} of the 1 unit of money that is being invested (i.e. w_{1} units of money) into the first share, which at the time of purchase costs 10 units of money. The investor therefore buys w_{1}/10 shares of the first stock. Similarly, the investor buys w_{2}/6 shares of the second stock. Problem 9.2. Consider a general single period market model with two risky assets and a money market account with interest rate r=0.1 . The state space consists of 3 states: \\Omega=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\} . Prices of risky assets at t=0 are S^{1}_{0}=4 , S^{2}_{0}=10 . Time t=1 prices are given by the following table: \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} S_{1}^{1} 3 5 7 S_{1}^{2} 15 20 10 The probabilities of the states under the physical (subjective) measure \\mathbb{P} are assumed to be \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{1})=\\frac{1}{6} and \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{2})=\\frac{1}{3} and \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_{3})=\\frac{1}{2} . (a)​Compute the returns R^{1} , R^{2} of the stocks. (b)​Compute the expectation, the variance and the covariance matrix of the returns of the stocks. (c)​Solve the Mean-Variance portfolio problem: find an optimal portfolio with the expected return equal to 50\\% . (d)​Using Lemma 3.4.2, find an optimal portfolio with the expected return equal to 100\\% . (e)​Find the Market Portfolio. What is the expected return of the market portfolio? (f)​Find the price for the call option (S^{2}_{1}-10)^{+} determined by the CAPM principle. Solution (a)​The returns are \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} R^{1} -1/4 1/4 3/4 R^{2} 1/2 1 0 (b)​We calculate like we did in Problem 9.1 and get \\mathbb{E}(R^{1})=\\frac{5}{12},\\quad\\mathbb{E}(R^{2})=\\frac{5}{12},\\quad% \\mathbb{E}((R^{1})^{2})=0.3125,\\quad\\mathbb{E}((R^{2})^{2})=0.375, which gives \\operatorname{Var}(R^{1})=0.1389 and \\operatorname{Var}(R^{2})=0.2014 . The covariance is \\operatorname{Cov}(R^{1},R^{2})=-0.1111 . (c)​We are searching for the proportional weights w_{0},w_{1} and w_{2} satisfying \\displaystyle\\min \\displaystyle\\operatorname{Var}(R) s.t. \\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}(R)=\\rho=0.5 \\displaystyle w_{0}+w_{1}+w_{2}=1. The Lagrangian is then \\mathcal{L}(w_{1},w_{2},\\lambda)=\\frac{1}{2}(w_{1}^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}% \\sigma_{2}^{2}+2w_{1}w_{2}\\sigma_{12})+\\lambda((1-w_{1}-w_{2})r+w_{1}\\bar{R}^{% 1}+w_{2}\\bar{R}^{2}-0.5). This leads to the equations \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{1}} \\displaystyle=w_{1}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+w_{2}\\sigma_{12}+\\lambda\\bar{R}^{1}-\\lambda r=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_{2}} \\displaystyle=w_{2}\\sigma_{2}^{2}+w_{1}\\sigma_{12}+\\lambda\\bar{R}^{2}-\\lambda r=0 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial\\lambda} \\displaystyle=(1-w_{1}-w_{2})r+w_{1}\\bar{R}^{1}+w_{2}\\bar{R}^{2}-0.5=0 Solving the system gives w_{1}=0.702 and w_{2}=0.562 , which therefore also gives w_{0}=1-w_{1}-w_{2}=-0.27 . (d)​We need \\mathbb{E}(\\tilde{R})=\\tilde{r}=1 . We have from (c) a portfolio \\hat{R} with expected return \\rho=0.5 . Using the formula from the previous exercise, we get \\gamma=\\frac{\\tilde{r}-\\rho}{r-\\rho}=\\frac{1-0.5}{0.1-0.5}=-\\frac{0.5}{0.4}=-1% .25. The weights in the new portfolio are therefore \\tilde{w}_{1}=(1-\\gamma)w_{1}=2.25w_{1}=1.58 and \\tilde{w}_{2}=(1-\\gamma)w_{2}=2.25w_{2}=1.264. \\tilde{w}_{0} can now be calculated either by adding \\gamma and (1-\\gamma)w_{0} together, or simply using that \\tilde{w}_{0}=1-\\tilde{w}_{1}-\\tilde{w}_{2} , either of which gives \\tilde{w}_{0}=-1.894 . (e)​To find the market portfolio, we can start with the portfolio from (c) and find \\gamma so that the resulting portfolio has \\tilde{w}_{0}=0 . This is equivalent to requiring that (1-\\gamma)(w_{1}+w_{2})=1 , i.e. (1-\\gamma)1.264=1, so that the suitable \\gamma=0.209 . The resulting market portfolio weights are then w_{1}^{M}=(1-\\gamma)w_{1}=(1-0.209)0.702=0.555 and w_{2}^{M}=(1-\\gamma)w_{2}=(1-0.209)0.562=0.445. The expected return of the market portfolio is \\mathbb{E}(R^{M})=w_{1}^{M}\\bar{R}^{1}+w_{2}^{M}\\bar{R}^{2}=\\frac{5}{12} (f)​We begin by calculating all of the necessary values \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{3} R^{M} 0.08375 0.58375 0.41625 X 5 10 0 Here, R^{M}(\\omega_{1}) was for example calculated as R^{M}(\\omega_{1})=w_{1}^{M}R^{1}(\\omega_{1})+w_{2}^{M}R^{2}(\\omega_{1})=0.555(% -\\frac{1}{4})+0.445(\\frac{1}{2})=0.08375. To calculate \\operatorname{Var}(R^{M}) we can calculate the first and second moment of R^{M} as in Problem 9.1(a), or calculate directly \\operatorname{Var}(R^{M})=(w_{1}^{M})^{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+(w_{2}^{M})^{2}\\sigma_% {2}^{2}+2w_{1}^{M}w_{2}^{M}\\sigma_{12}=0.0231. The CAPM then tells us \\mathbb{E}(\\underbrace{R}_{\\frac{X-x}{x}})-r=\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(R,R^{M})% }{\\operatorname{Var}(R^{M})}(\\mathbb{E}(R^{M})-r) so x=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}(X)-\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,R^{M})}{\\operatorname{Var}(R^% {M})}(\\mathbb{E}(R^{M})-r)}{1+r}. To calculate the above, we still require \\operatorname{Cov}(X,R^{M}) , which we calculate next. We have \\mathbb{E}(XR^{M})=\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot 5\\cdot 0.08375+\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 10\\cdot 0.% 5838+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 0\\cdot 0.41625=2.015792 and \\mathbb{E}(X)=\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot 5+\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 10+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 0=\\frac{% 25}{6}. Consequently, the covariance is \\operatorname{Cov}(X,R^{M})=2.015792-\\frac{25}{6}\\frac{5}{12}=0.27968. The resulting \\beta is then \\beta=\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,R^{M})}{\\operatorname{Var}(R^{M})}=12.10736 and we can finally calculate the price x=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}(X)-\\beta(\\bar{R}^{M}-r)}{1+r}=\\frac{\\frac{25}{6}-12.10736(% \\frac{5}{12}-0.1)}{1.1}=0.30243, which is the CAPM price of the call option. With this price, the expected return of the option is \\mathbb{E}(R^{X})=\\mathbb{E}(\\frac{X-x}{x})=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}(X)-x}{x}=\\frac{% \\frac{25}{6}-0.30243}{0.30243}=12.77729.

You should carefully try to solve all the exercises each week as a preparation for the seminars where the solutions will be discussed. Full solutions to the problems will only be provided at the end of teaching, so you should make sure to write your own solutions based on your own work and the discussions during the seminars. Numerical solutions can be found at the end of each problem sheet. You can use these to verify if your solutions are correct.
